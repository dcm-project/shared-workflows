# DCM Shared Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for DCM project repositories.

## Usage

In your repository, create a workflow file that calls a shared workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: dcm-project/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/<workflow>.yaml@main
```

See individual workflow files for available options and inputs.
